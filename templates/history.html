    <h1>History of Our Trust</h1>
    <p>
        Our trust, <strong>NADAR URAVINMURAI</strong>, was established in the year 1980 by a group of passionate community leaders
        who believed in the power of unity and social upliftment. The founders envisioned an organization
        that would serve the needs of the underprivileged and support education, health, and welfare in our region.
    </p>
    <p>
        In its early days, the trust operated from a small office and conducted programs such as tuition centers,
        medical camps, and food distribution drives. Over time, our activities grew stronger with the support
        of donors, volunteers, and committed members. Today, the trust owns land, buildings, and actively supports
        hundreds of families every year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Major milestones include:
        <ul>
            <li>1990 - Inauguration of our first tuition center</li>
            <li>2000 - Launch of our annual scholarship program</li>
            <li>2010 - Construction of our trust building</li>
            <li>2020 - Introduction of digital services and online meetings</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        We remain committed to our mission and look forward to growing even further with the support of our members.
